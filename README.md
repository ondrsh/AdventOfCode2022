# adventofcode2022

This is my first public repo, so Hello World :)

The code style varies, sometimes it's all about performance and other times about having simple readable code.
Haven't completed all days because I've been busy in December. Might do that once the next AoC starts.

Just a note - some solutions depend on an internal helper library which isn't released. Maybe I'll update those parts at some point so no external stuff will be needed to run the code.
Enjoy browsing and happy coding!
